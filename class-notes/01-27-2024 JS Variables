RECAP

Note: let is mutable (you can change it)

let address = "Chicago";
address= "Miami"; // allowed


const does not change ie SSN, Pi, 

const pi = 3.14;
pi = 5; // not allowed 


Declaration 
let address;
const you must give value immediately 
const pi = 3.14;



Assignment 
address = 'Chicago'




Reassignment 
updating the current address or assignment 
address = 'Miami';




Initialization = declaration + assignment 
let address = 'Chicago';



VARIABLE NAMING RULES 
    Syntax:
        -the first character of the variable cannot be a digit. digits can be used after first character
        - spaces are not allowed in variable name ie let first name = 'John';
        -only special characters allowed are _, $. 
        -reserve keywords cannot be used as the first characters ie var let const static byte
        - do not use a variable name twice, it will be a compiler (syntax error)



    Conventions:
            -camelCase rule for naming variables that has multiple 
            -usually start with lower case
            -variables should have meaningful names 
            -
