INFINITE LOOP: A loop created by mistake and never stops
for(let i = 0; i <= 1; i--) {
    // block
}

for( ; ; ) {
    // block
}

// For loop 
for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}


// While loop 
let i = 1;

while(i <= 10) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}



if you know exactly how many times your loop is going to iterate -> FOR LOOP
if you don't know how many times your loop is going to iterate -> WHILE or DO-WHILE LOOP



                                        Do you know how many total number of interations?
                                    YES                                                 NO
                                    for loop                                           while or do-while

                                                                                is it running at least once?
                                                                            YES                     NO
                                                                            DO-WHILE                WHILE





Divide your task into 3 parts

1. Create your default variables which will eventually be your results
2. Loop thru your date and fill out your default variables
3. Return or log your results


let count = 0;

for(let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
    if(i % 2 === 0) count++;
}
console.log(count);


3, 5    -> 1
1, 7    -> 3
13, 20  -> 4


function countEven(start, end) {
    let count = 0;

    for(let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
         if(i % 2 === 0) count++;
    }

    return count;
}

console.log(countEven(13, 20));
