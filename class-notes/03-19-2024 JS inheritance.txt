RECAP:

JS Prototypes or Classes are used to improve the reusability of the objects

Prototype or class = template from which you can create many objects 
Objects or instances are created from prototypes or classes using constructor together with new keyword

CONSTRUCTOR: special method used to create objects 

BEFORE ES6 - Prototype 

1. create a constructor function
function Dog(name, breed, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.age = age;
}

2. add prototype functions 

Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
    //body
}

3. Create your objects from the Dog constructor function

const dog1 = new Dog('Lucky', 'German Shephard', 3);
const dog2 = new Dog('ab', 'German Shephard', 2);
const dog3 = new Dog('xy', 'Collie', 4);



AFTER ES6 
class Dog {
    constructor(name, breed, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
        this.age = age;
    }

    bark() {
        // body
    }
}

const dog1 = new Dog('Lucky', 'German Shephard', 3);
const dog2 = new Dog('ab', 'German Shephard', 2);
const dog3 = new Dog('xy', 'Collie', 4);


INHERITANCE RULES 
-inheriting prototype or class will be considered as child
-inherited prototype or class will be considered as parent 
-parent can have multiple children
-child can have only one parent



ES6 Classes 

class A extends B {

}

- in this case A is the child class - subclass 
- B is parent class - super class - base class

Classes provide you the default constructor when you don't create any custom ones.
However, it will be gone once you create a custom constructor

class Person {

}

class Person {
    constructor() {} // this is here bu default
}

const p = new Person();
