Destructuring: is a helpful feature to get some elements or properties from arrays ot objects.

Array Destructuring:

const arr = ['Biking', 'Coding', 'Reading', 'PS5'];

const fav1Act = arr[0];
const fav2Act = arr[1];
const fav3Act = arr[2];
const fav4Act = arr[3];

// Destructuring
const [fav1Act, fav2Act, fav3Act, fav4Act] = arr;
// Skip some elements in the middle, if you want to skip the first one then commas come first
const [fav1Act, , , fav4Act] = arr;


// OOP - Object Oriented Programming
Allows programmers to put real-life objects into programming 


compiled languages like Java, C#, TypeScript
These are class oriented OOP languages

JavaScript
Prototype-based functional language 
ES6 added classes in JS as well.



TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. it does all JS does + it is a typed language.
let a = 'John';

a = 25;

a = true;

a = new Date();

a was string, then number, then  boolean

In the above example, you can see that JavaScript is dynamically-typed language.

Statically-typed languages like Java, C#
int num = 4;

num = false; // error

String name = "John";
name = new Date();

TypeScript
let a:string = 'John';

a = 25; // Error
